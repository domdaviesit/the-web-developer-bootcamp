  <h1>Section 3 Notes (just a html scratch pad!)</h1>
  <h2>To indicate that your HTML content uses HTML5, simply use: !DOCTYPE html</h2>
  <p>Doing so will cause even browsers that don't presently support HTML5 to enter into standards mode, which means that they'll
    interpret the long-established parts of HTML in an HTML5-compliant way while ignoring the new features of HTML5 they
    don't support. This is much simpler than the former doctypes, and shorter, making it easier to remember and reducing
    the amount of bytes that must be downloaded.</p>

  <p>The HTML element represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root element.
    All other elements must be descendants of this element.</p>
  <h3>Strong, not bold. em not italics</h3>
  <p>Reason is meaning for screen readers and visually impared users.</p>

  <h2>Divs and Spans - are generic containers</h2>

  <p>divs can group related content. Make things block level.</p>
  <p>spans work with content inline.</p>

  <h2>Attributes</h2>
  <p>src is a attribute of img tag. href, class and id are attributes.</p>
  <h3>Images</h3>

  <h1>Challenge 1</h1>

  <h2>Lists assignment</h2>
  <h4>Below is a test Colt asked us to code from a screenshot.</h4>
  <p>One thing I noticed from the solution video is that Colt doesn't just code the whole thing and then see if it works. He
    codes a small chunk and tests it. He builds the code testing as he goes along.</p>
